This is a fork from https://github.com/Hubbitus/shell.scripts.
I just changed it so that it works with Firefox Nightly instead of Firefox.

# Dependencies

[Window Titler](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/window-titler/)

# How to use

First, install Window Titler and set it up so that it adds [*workspace-name*] in front of window title.

Then, get the file and run.
```
git clone https://github.com/SinTan1729/Firefox-Nightly-Auto-Place-Windows-by-Workspace/
cd "Firefox-Nightly-Auto-Place-Windows-by-Workspace"
NightlyAutoPlaceWindow
```
